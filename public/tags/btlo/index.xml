      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my write-up for the retired Blue Team Labs Online challenge &amp;lsquo;Employee of the Year&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a Friday evening when you were in a mood to celebrate your weekend, your team was alerted with a new RCE vulnerability actively being exploited in the wild. You have been tasked with analysing and researching the sample to collect information for the weekend team.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-of-investigation&#34;&gt;Process of Investigation:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This challenge took some additional work before I could start work on the investigation. After downloading and extracting the contents of the challenge zip file, there was just one file, &amp;lsquo;recoverfiles.dd&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my write-up for &amp;lsquo;The Planet&amp;rsquo;s Prestige&amp;rsquo;. This is a CTF-Like challenge, that is now &amp;lsquo;Retired&amp;rsquo;, on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blueteamlabs.online/home&#34;&gt;Blue Team Labs Online&lt;/a&gt; cybersecurity practice and challenge platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When challenges are retired, this means that leaderboard points are not awarded, but then write-ups for the challenge are permitted to be made public.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I have only recently received a certification for cybersecurity, and I am using this platform as part of my learning experience to complete challenges and tasks. This is in an effort to better prepare me as I start to look into progressing in to the field of cybersecurity for a career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
