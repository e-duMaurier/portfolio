      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our SIEM alerted us to a suspicious logon event which needs to be looked at immediately. The alert details were that the IP Address and the Source Workstation name were a mismatch. You are provided a network capture and event logs from the surrounding time around the incident timeframe. Correlate the given evidence and report back to your SOC Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my write-up of the retired ‘Sherlock’ challenge, Reaper. Sherlocks are investigative challenges, to help develop and test defensive cybersecurity skills. Retired content on Hack The Box, has write-ups enabled, and I think that this would be a good opportunity to work through a challenge, and practice my documentation while working through the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
