      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my write-up of the retired &amp;lsquo;Sherlock&amp;rsquo; challenge, Reaper. Sherlocks are investigative challenges, to help develop and test defensive cybersecurity skills. Retired content on Hack The Box, has write-ups enabled, and I think that this would be a good opportunity to work through a challenge, and practice my documentation while working through the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our SIEM alerted us to a suspicious logon event which needs to be looked at immediately. The alert details were that the IP Address and the Source Workstation name were a mismatch. You are provided a network capture and event logs from the surrounding time around the incident timeframe. Correlate the given evidence and report back to your SOC Manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my write-up for &amp;lsquo;The Planet&amp;rsquo;s Prestige&amp;rsquo;. This is a CTF-Like challenge, that is now &amp;lsquo;Retired&amp;rsquo;, on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blueteamlabs.online/home&#34;&gt;Blue Team Labs Online&lt;/a&gt; cybersecurity practice and challenge platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When challenges are retired, this means that leaderboard points are not awarded, but then write-ups for the challenge are permitted to be made public.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I have only recently received a certification for cybersecurity, and I am using this platform as part of my learning experience to complete challenges and tasks. This is in an effort to better prepare me as I start to look into progressing in to the field of cybersecurity for a career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
