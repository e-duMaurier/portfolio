      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have been sent a phishing link. Sadly the threat actor doesn’t know who they were dealing with. From only one phishing link find out all you can about the person responsible and bring them to justice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;❗ &lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;The website and kit in this lab is REAL.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Exercise caution when interacting with the malicious website and do not enter any sensitive information!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ℹ️ &lt;strong&gt;INFO&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;As the website referenced is a live website, any references, or links to URLs, IP addresses etc in this write-up have been ‘defanged’. I do not hold any responsibility for anyone using these links.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Purify Black Energy 2 from Shadowbrook’s digital infrastructure by reverse-engineering the malware’s code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-of-investigation&#34;&gt;Process of Investigation:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the investigation environment loads, there are a few files and directories already on the desktop. There were directories for the applications CyberChef and volatility, and files &lt;code&gt;readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; file, and &lt;code&gt;BlackEnergy.vnem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The readme file was small, and only contained the text:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-code&#34; data-lang=&#34;code&#34;&gt;WinXPSP2x86 is the profile you must use.  &#xA;It is best to place the output of the vol2 commands to a .txt file for better readability.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volatility was provided on the desktop of the investigation, so I started with running &lt;code&gt;volatility&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;pslist&lt;/code&gt; command, with the profile &lt;code&gt;WinXPSP2x86&lt;/code&gt; as suggested by the readme file, against the image file, then saving the output to a text file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a Friday evening when you were in a mood to celebrate your weekend, your team was alerted with a new RCE vulnerability actively being exploited in the wild. You have been tasked with analysing and researching the sample to collect information for the weekend team.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-of-investigation&#34;&gt;Process of Investigation:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This challenge took some additional work before I could start work on the investigation. After downloading and extracting the contents of the challenge zip file, there was just one file, ‘recoverfiles.dd’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our SIEM alerted us to a suspicious logon event which needs to be looked at immediately. The alert details were that the IP Address and the Source Workstation name were a mismatch. You are provided a network capture and event logs from the surrounding time around the incident timeframe. Correlate the given evidence and report back to your SOC Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my write-up of the retired ‘Sherlock’ challenge, Reaper. Sherlocks are investigative challenges, to help develop and test defensive cybersecurity skills. Retired content on Hack The Box, has write-ups enabled, and I think that this would be a good opportunity to work through a challenge, and practice my documentation while working through the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CoCanDa, a planet known as ‘The Heaven of the Universe’ has been having a bad year. A series of riots have taken place across the planet due to the frequent abduction of citizens, known as CoCanDians, by a mysterious force. CoCanDa’s Planetary President arranged a war-room with the best brains and military leaders to work on a solution. After the meeting concluded the President was informed his daughter had disappeared. CoCanDa agents spread across multiple planets were working day and night to locate her. Two days later and there’s no update on the situation, no demand for ransom, not even a single clue regarding the whereabouts of the missing people. On the third day a CoCanDa representative, an Army Major on Earth, received an email.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
