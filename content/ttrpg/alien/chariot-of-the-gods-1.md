### Act 1:

The year is 2183, and the USCSS Montero is transporting 200,000 tonnes of Tritium gas from Anchorpoint station through The Gauntlet, a trade route in the Frontier, to Sutters World.

While the Montero's sensors developed a glitch before you left Anchorpoint, the cargo run had been without incident.

Now out of Cryosleep, the crew woke up, got fed and hydrated after a little over a year in cryosleep. The sensors pinged again, and Mother suggested the Montero was on a collision course with another ship. Seeing nothing in the void of Space, not even stars, Davis performed an emergency manoeuvre and stopped just short of impact with another vessel.

Pulling back some distance and activating all on-board lights, the crew of the Montero had found a Science-Exploration ship, the USCSS Cronus, which has been missing for 73 years.

After Weyland-Yutani corporate liaison interacted with Mother, he convinced the rest of the crew that everyone would need to take part in the salvage of the Cronus, and it's contents. Or forfeit any company shares and lose contracted credits for their current transport contract.

Gathering the equipment that was available onboard the Montero, the crew hooked up the umbilical to the Cronus main airlock. Cham, the Montero cargo handler, was first to get to the airlock door, and saw that it was buckled from the inside. The airlock door would not open easily, and would have to be cut open. There were also gouges on the outside, these did not look like anything that might happen from space debris or asteroids hitting the vessel.

They took the time to check out the possible entry point on the vehicle deck of the Cronus, but saw the door was not fully sealed. It would need to be sealed properly before the door could be re-opened to allow the crew to enter.

Back to the main airlock door, and after half hour with the cutting torch, the crew were able to enter. The door still unsealed, and only the umbilical and the Montero, programmed and maintaining speed and course aided by Mother, keeping the area pressurised.

After entering the Cronus, Cham noticed more gouges on the inside of the door, these resembling scratches made by a large hand, with large fingernails.

The crew decided as they were close to Mother's chamber, they attempted to access this first, but the Access Cards of both Wilson and Captain Miller were not able to access the chamber. An access card from the Cronus would be required. The crew decided the Bridge should be the next stop.

Heading towards the stairwell, they saw a body slumped against the wall, wearing security clothing, the body was missing its head. A large, dried splatter of blood on the wall, and a shotgun in its hands. Wilson took the weapon and ammo, and while searching for a key card, noticed that the arms and legs of this body were unnaturally long, looking like they'd stretched. Some bullet holes were also found in the body, but with no blood stains around them, these looked to have been made post-mortem.

Down the main stairwell, Cham was keeping an eye on the motion tracker, seeing nothing, but when they were entering the armoury, movement was noticed about 40m south, of them, then vanished.

Inside the armoury, this had been stripped bare, with almost nothing left except a Weyland Storm Rifle and some ammo. A dried, milky, white, substance was seen sprayed across a wall, possibly from a Synthetic, but no other signs of struggle. It was also noted that the two EEVs accessible from the armoury had already been ejected. The crew then headed towards the bridge. There were signs of a fire on the bridge at some point, soot, and ash on the ceiling and walls, and everything looked to be on battery power, unusable, until full power restored. However, pilot station 1 was completely disabled, as an axe had been taken to it, and was still embedded in the station.
