## Hello, I'm Emma.

I’m an experienced IT professional with over 7 years of technical support expertise and a fervent passion for modern IT environments. My journey in the world of technology began in the mid 1980’s when we got an Acorn Electron computer, and had to load games from cassette tapes, or type in all the code manually, from magazines.

That early passion never faded, and developed in to building PCs, configuring home networks and getting some basic knowledge of programming with C++ and Pascal, in the late 1990’s. Since then, I’ve continued with that passion, always wanted to learn and experience more. I’ve experienced more with programming languages C# and Java, I’ve honed a robust understanding of virtualisation technologies including Hyper-V, VMware ESXi & Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Proxmox.

As a Linux enthusiast, I’ve adopted it as my daily operating system and have been utilising VMs on bare-metal setups and cloud VPS to host open-source applications. My exploration of containerisation with Docker has further enhanced my skills in this area.

I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. Developing my cyber security knowledge by taking a SOC100 course with [Level Effect](https://www.leveleffect.com/), alongside furthering my knowledge and experience with several other online platforms and resources.
